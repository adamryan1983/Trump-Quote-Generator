# Trump-Quote-Generator

This is a basic jQuery plugin that allows a user to take a portion of html, place it on a page, and have a fully functioning Trump Quote Generator.

##Instructions:

- Download the html generator snippet, place it on your html document in the location you want it to show up.
- Download the two JS files and place them in the head of your html document like this:
    <script src="jquery.trumpGenerator.js" defer></script>
    <script src="app.js" defer></script>
    
    Note: make sure you reference the proper directory for the js files on your server.
    
 - you will also need jQuery for this to work, so place this CDN above the other two links. It is important that you place them in this specific order:
     <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     
     Order:
     jQuery CDN
     jquery Plugin
     App.js
     
All of the required styling is included in the plugin html snippet.
